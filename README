 me:  Main Story is 10 scripted events that increase in difficulty
Shoot for tweet sized story components per event

 me:  Write about 4 main stories
Randomly selected when you start game, or character choices based
Write about 30 random side quests, 1-3 events each
side quests happen instead of main quest event about 10% of time
If you find something else to do you can delve for treasure or hunt monsters or similar
same event eacg time like "You are attacked by a rat!"
 Aaron:  Fight in the arena.
 me:  but 10% of the time you get a random side quest instead
nice
When you rest, 5-10% chance of side quest
or shop
thats it
some side quests are dependent on earlier ones
 Aaron:  Roll all the dice. Make a story.
 me:  yeah
also level up your dude
int, str, cha, armor, weapon, shield
